# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm an **Applied Mathematics** and **Scientific Computing** student at the **University of São Paulo (USP)**, currently diving deep into **optimization**, **data science**, and **statistics**. I'm passionate about leveraging my knowledge to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions! 🚀

## 🧠 **Career Studies**
- **Optimization**
- **Data Science**
- **Statistics**

I am particularly fascinated by how mathematical concepts and computational techniques can be applied to real-world problems to optimize processes and systems.

## 💻 **Programming Languages & Tools**
I have hands-on experience with several programming languages and tools, including:
- **C** 🖥️
- **C++** 💻
- **Java** ☕
- **Python** 🐍
- **R** 📊
- **GDScript** 🎮
- **Jupyter Notebooks** 📒
- **Matlab/Octave** 🧮

These languages allow me to tackle a variety of computational problems across multiple domains, from software development to data analysis.

## 🔍 **Special Interests**
I have a special focus on the following areas:
